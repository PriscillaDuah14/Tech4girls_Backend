1.⁠ ⁠int: This data type represents integer values, which are whole numbers without a decimal point.
   Example:
   ⁠ python
   age = 25
    ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠float: This represents floating-point numbers, which are numbers that contain a decimal point.
   Example:
   ⁠ python
   temperature = 36.6
    ⁠

3.⁠ ⁠str: This data type is used for strings, which are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.
   Example:
   ⁠ python
   name = "Prissy"
    ⁠

4.⁠ ⁠list: A list is an ordered collection of items that can be changed (mutable). Lists can contain different data types.
   Example:
   ⁠ python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    ⁠

5.⁠ ⁠tuple: A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning its contents cannot be changed after creation.
   Example:
   ⁠ python
   coordinates = (10, 20)
    ⁠

6.⁠ ⁠set: A set is an unordered collection of unique items. It automatically removes duplicate values.
   Example:
   ⁠ python
   unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}  # This will be {1, 2, 3, 4}
    ⁠
