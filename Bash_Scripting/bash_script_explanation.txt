A Bash script is a plain text file that contains a series of commands to be executed by the Bash shell. 
It allows you to automate tasks, run multiple commands in sequence, and simplify complex operations. 
Bash scripts can be used for system administration, file manipulation, program execution, and more.

These are the steps to create a Bash script:

1.⁠ ⁠Open your terminal.
2.⁠ ⁠Use a text editor to create a new file. For example, you can use touch:
   
   touch script_name.sh
   

3.⁠ ⁠Start the script with a shebang line to specify the interpreter:
   bash
   #!/bin/bash
   

4.⁠ ⁠Add your commands below the shebang line. For example:
   
   echo "Hello, World!"
   

5.⁠ ⁠Save the file 

6.⁠ ⁠Make the script executable with:
   
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   

7.⁠ ⁠Run the script with:
   
   ./script_name.sh
   

This will execute the commands in the script.
