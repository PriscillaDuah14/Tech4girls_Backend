tring representation of the read file permission in Unix-like systems is denoted by the letter r. In the context of file permissions, it is part of a set of three characters that represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others. 

For example, if a file has permissions set to rw-r--r--, it means:
- The owner has read and write permissions (rw-).
- The group has read permission only (r--).
- Others also have read permission only (r--).
