To create the Backend_Projects directory in my home directory and then add ProjectA and ProjectB as subdirectories, I would use the following commands:

1. Create the Backend_Projects directory:

mkdir ~/Backend_Projects


2. Create ProjectA and ProjectB subdirectories inside Backend_Projects:

mkdir ~/Backend_Projects/ProjectA
mkdir ~/Backend_Projects/ProjectB
